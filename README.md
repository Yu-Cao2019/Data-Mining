# Data-Mining

This is the first course I learn in data science department. It is a very great course to lay a solid foundation for python learning.

In this repo, I just uploaded my final project. The original repo is in [my teammate's Github](https://github.com/weifeiwang0906/FinalProject-Group3). I just uploaded the final results and my own part so that people can view my contribution easily.

In the future, I will also upload many other python code and exercise from my course so that we can communicate and learn. And I will also improve my project later.

PS: Thanks for my course professor Amir. By taking his course, I experienced the joy of programming and the pride of solving problems with programming! In this repo, I will upload materials I learn in this course. The resourses come from professor Amir. Here is his Github: [Amir-Jafari](https://github.com/amir-jafari).
